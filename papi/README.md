# My personal notes on PAPI

Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI), primarily maintained by a group at the University of Tennessee

* http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/
* Use of low-level performance counter hardware
* CPU, GPU, memory, interconnects, I/O system, energy/power, etc.
* Accesses hardware (processor) counters like instructions, floating point operations, branches predicted/taken, cache accesses/misses, TLB misses, cycles, stall cycles, etc.
* Used by tools like Periscope, Scalasca, TAU, VampirTrace, etc.

## SDumont note

The purpose of running on SDumont is to learn how it works, and to see how it can be used in the approved project

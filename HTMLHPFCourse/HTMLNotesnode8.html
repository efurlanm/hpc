<P>
Fortran&nbsp;90 is a major revision of its predecessor many of the inadequacies of
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 have been addressed:
<P>
<OL><LI> Fortran&nbsp;90 defines a new code format which is much more like every other
language;
<UL><LI> free format -- no reliance on specific positioning of special
characters;<LI> upto 132 columns per line;<LI> more than one statement per line;<LI> in-line comments allowed (this makes it easier to annotate code);<LI> upper and lower case letters allowed (makes code more readable);<LI> it is virtually impossible to misplace a character now;<LI> longer and more descriptive object names (upto 31 characters);<LI> names can be punctuated by underscores making then more readable.
</UL><LI> Parallelism can now be expressed using whole array operations
which include extensive slicing and sectioning
facilities. Arithmetic may now be performed 
on whole arrays and array sections. Operations in an
array valued expression are conceptually performed in parallel.
<P>
To support this feaature, many parallel intrinsic  functions have 
been introduced including
reduction operations such as <TT>SUM</TT> (add all elements in an array and
return one value -- the sum)  and <TT>MAXVAL</TT> (scan all elements in an
array and
return one value -- the biggest). This concept comes from APL.
<P>
The masked (parallel) assignment (<TT>WHERE</TT>) statement is also a new
feature.<LI> The introduction of dynamic (heap) storage means that pointers and
allocatable arrays can be implemented. 
Temporary arrays can now be created on-the-fly, pointers can be
used for aliasing arrays or sections of arrays 
and implementing dynamic data structures such as
linked lists and trees.<LI> To combat non-portability, the <TT>KIND</TT> facility has been introduced. 
This mechanism allows the user to specify the 
desired precision of an object in a portable way. Type specifications
can be parameterised meaning that the precision of a particular type
can be changed by
altering the value of one constant. Appropriate intrinsic inquiry
functions are defined to query the precision of given objects.<LI> User-defined types, which are constructed from existing types, can
now be constructed. For
example, a type can be defined to represent a 3D coordinate which has
three components (<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>,<I>z</I>) or a different type can be used to represent
personal details: name, age, sex address, phone number
etc. Defining objects in this way is more intuitive and makes
programming easier and less error prone.<LI> Explicit recursion is now available. For reasons of efficiency the
user must declare a procedure to be recursive but it can then be used to
call itself.<LI> Facility packaging has been introduced -- <TT>MODULE</TT> s replace many
features of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77. They can be used for global definitions (of types,
objects, operators and procedures),  and can be used to provide
functionality whose internal details are hidden from the user (data
hiding).
<P>
Reshaping and retyping functions have been added to the language which
means that features that relied on storage association (such a
<TT>EQUIVALENCE</TT>) do not have to be used.
<P>
</OL>
<UL><LI> procedure interfaces which declare procedure  and argument  names and
types
 can now be specified, this means that:
<UL><LI> programs and procedures can be separately compiled -- more efficient
development;<LI> array bounds do not have to be passed as arguments;<LI> array shape can be inherited from the actual argument;<LI> better type checking exists across procedure boundaries;<LI> more efficient code can be generated.
</UL><LI> new control constructs have been introduced, for example,
<P>
<UL><LI> <TT>DO</TT> ... <TT>END</TT><TT>DO</TT> (not part of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77) this will  reduce use
of numeric labels in the program;<LI> <TT>DO</TT> ... <TT>WHILE</TT> loop;<LI> the <TT>EXIT</TT> command for gracefully exiting a loop;<LI> the <TT>CYCLE</TT> command for abandoning the current iteration of a loop
and commencing the next one;<LI> named control constructs which are useful for code readability;<LI> <TT>SELECT</TT> <TT>CASE</TT> control block. which
is more succinct, elegant and efficient than an <TT>IF</TT> ....
<TT>ELSE</TT><TT>IF</TT> ... <TT>ELSE</TT><TT>IF</TT> block.
<P>
</UL><LI> Internal procedures are now allowed. A procedure is allowed to
contain a further procedure with local scope -- it cannot be accessed
from outside of the procedure within which it is defined.<LI> It is now possible to define and overload operators for derived and 
intrinsic data types which
mean  that so-called `semantic extension' can be performed, For example,
an arbitrary length integer can be implemented using a linked list
structure (one digit per cell) and then all the intrinsic operators 
defined (overloaded) so that
this  type can be treated in the same way as all other types. The language
thus appears to have been extended. All intrinsic operators <TT>+, -, *,
/</TT> and <TT>**</TT> and assignment, <TT>=</TT>, can be overloaded (defined for
new types).<LI> <TT>MODULE</TT> s also  provide object based facilities for Fortran&nbsp;90, for example, it is
possible to use a module to implement the abovementioned long integer
data type -- all required facilities (for example, definitions, objects,
operators, overloaded intrinsics
and manipulation procedures) may be packaged together in a <TT>MODULE</TT>,
the user simple has to <TT>USE</TT> this module to have all the features
instantly available. The module can now be used like a library unit.<LI> An ancillary standard, `The varying strings module', has been
defined and is implemented in a module. When using this module, the user
can simply declare an
object of the appropriate type (<TT>VARYING_STRING</TT>) which can be
manipulated in exactly the same fashion as the intrinsic character type.
All intrinsic
operations and procedures are included in the module and are therefore
available for all objects of this type.  All the implementation details
are hidden from the user.<LI> useful libraries can be written  and placed in a module.<LI> <TT>BLOCK</TT> <TT>DATA</TT> subprograms are now redundant since a <TT>MODULE</TT> can
be used for the same purpose.

<P>
     Fortran, which originally stood for <I>IBM Mathematical FORmula 
TRANslation System</I> but has been abbreviated to <I>FORmula TRANslation</I>, 
 is the oldest of the established ``high-level'' languages, having
 been designed by a group in IBM during the late 1950s.  The language
 became so popular in the early 1960s that other vendors started to produce
 their own versions and this led to a growing divergence of dialects 
(by 1963 there were 40 different compilers).  It was
 recognised that such divergence was not in the interests of either the
 computer users or the computer vendors and so F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;66 became the first
 language to be officially standardised in 1972 (it is quite common for
the Fortran version number to be out of step with the standardisation
year).  The publication of the standard meant that Fortran
 became more widely implemented than any other language.  By the mid 
 1970s virtually every computer, mini or mainframe, was supplied with a
 standard-conforming F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;66  language processing system.  It was
 therefore possible to write programs in Fortran on any one system and be
 reasonably confident that these could be moved fairly easily to work on any
 other system.  This, and the fact
 that Fortran programs could be processed very efficiently, led to Fortran
 being the most heavily-used programming language for non-commercial
 applications.
<P>
      The standard definition of Fortran was updated in the late 1970's and
 a new standard, ANSI X3.9-1978, was published by the American National
 Standards Institute.  This standard was subsequently (in 1980) adopted by
 the International Standards Organisation (ISO) as an International Standard
 (IS 1539 : 1980). The language is commonly known as F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 (since the final draft
 was actually completed in 1977) and is the version of the language now in
 widespread use. Compilers, which
usually support a small number of extensions have, over the years,
become <EM>very</EM> efficient. The technology which as been developed
during the implementation of these compilers will not be wasted as it can still 
be applied to Fortran&nbsp;90 programs.
<P>
The venerable nature of Fortran and the rather conservative character
of the 1977 standard revision left F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 with a number of old-fashioned
 facilities that might be termed deficiencies, or at least
infelicities. Many desirable features were
not available, for example, in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 it is very difficult to represent data
structures succinctly and the lack of any dynamic storage means that all
arrays must have a fixed size which can not be exceeded; it was
clear from a very early stage that a new, more modern, language needed to
be developed. Work began in early 80's on a language known as `Fortran 8x'.
(`x' was expected to be 8 in keeping with the previous names for Fortran.) 
The work took 12 years partly due to the desire to keep F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 a strict subset
and also to ensure that efficiency (one of the bonus's of a simple language)
was not compromised. Languages such as Pascal, ADA and Algol are a treat
to use but cannot match Fortran for efficiency.
<P>
Fortran&nbsp;90 is a major development of the language but nevertheless it
includes all of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 as a strict subset and so any standard conforming
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 program will continue to be a valid Fortran&nbsp;90 program.
The main reason for this is due 
to the vast amount of so-called  `dusty deck' programs that litter Scientific
installations all over the world. Many man-years have been put
into writing these programs which, after so many years of use (that is 
in-the-field testing), are very reliable. Most of the dusty deck
codes will be F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 but there are doubtless many lines of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;66 too.
<P>
In addition to the old F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 constructs, 
 Fortran&nbsp;90 allows programs to be expressed in ways that are more
 suited to a modern computing environment and has rendered obsolete many
of the mechanisms that were appropriate in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77.  Here, we 
 have tried to present an approach to programming which uses the new
 features of Fortran&nbsp;90 to good effect and which will result in portable,
 efficient, safe and maintainable code.  We do not intended to present a
 complete description of every possible feature of the language.
<P>
In Fortran&nbsp;90 some features of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 have been replaced by better, safer and
more efficient features, many of these are to be removed from the next
interim revision of the language -- 
Fortran&nbsp;95 although it is expected that many compilers will still support
them as `extensions'. Tools exist to effect automatic removal of such
obsolescent features, examples of these are (Pacific Sierra
Research's) VAST90 and (NA Software's) LOFT90 In addition, these
tools perform differing amounts of vectorisation (transliteration of
serial structures to equivalent parallel structures).
<P>
As the Fortran&nbsp;90 standard is very large and complex there are (inevitably) 
a small  number of
ambiguities / conflicts / grey areas.  Such anomalies often only come to
light when compliers are developed. Since standardisation many 
compilers have been under development and a number of these anomalies 
have been identified. A new standard, Fortran&nbsp;95, 
will recitify these faults and extend the language in the appropriate
areas. In the last couple of years the Fortran&nbsp;90 based language known as
High Performance Fortran (HPF) has been developed. This language contains the
whole of Fortran&nbsp;90 and also includes other desirable extensions. Fortran&nbsp;95 will
include many of the new features from HPF<A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="HTMLNotesfootnode.html#1194"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="localIcons/foot_motif.gif" width="15" height="20"></A>, [<A HREF="HTMLNotesnode306.html#HPF93">5</A>].

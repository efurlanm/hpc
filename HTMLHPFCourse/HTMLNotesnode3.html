F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77  has been widely used by scientists and engineers for a number of
years now. It has been a very successful language but is now showing
signs of age, in the last few years there has been a tendency for people
to drift away from F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 and begin to use C, Ada or C++. The Fortran
standard has now been revised to bring it up to date with a new improved
language, known informally as Fortran&nbsp;90, being defined.. 
Comparisons have been (rightly) drawn between the new Fortran standard
 and APL, ADA and C++. All
three languages contain elements which make them the `flavour of the
month', they are, to some degree, <EM>object oriented</EM>. The criteria for
what makes a language actually 
object oriented is debatable but the new operator overloading, user defined
typing  and <TT>MODULE</TT> packaging features of Fortran&nbsp;90 certainly help to
forward its case. Along with ADA and APL it uses the concept of array operations
and reduction operators; Fortran&nbsp;90 also supports user defined generic
procedures to enhance usability but these are implemented in a simpler
and more efficient way than in ADA.
<P>
Here we highlight the new Fortran&nbsp;90 features which make language more robust
and useable, for example, of those mentioned above, many are 
object-based facilities which make it more difficult to make mistakes
or do daft things. Fortran&nbsp;90 is also comparable to ADA in the sense that it
too has many restrictions detailed in the standard document meaning that
mistakes, which in other languages (such as C, C++ and F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77) would be
syntactically correct but cause an odd action to be taken, are ruled out
at compile time. As an example of this, if explicit interfaces are used then it
is not possible to associate dummy and actual arguments of different
types -- this was possible in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 and was sometimes used in anger but
generally indicated an error.

<P>
A Fortran&nbsp;90 program <EM>must</EM> contain a main program where execution begins, it
could also contain other user-defined procedures which may be:
<P>
<UL><LI> <EM>external</EM> -- defined externally to the procedure which
              calls them and which can be compiled separately.<LI> <EM>internal</EM> -- whose definition is contained within the procedure
              or main program that calls them (called the <EM>host</EM>).<LI> <EM>module-procedures</EM> -- have some characteristics of both internal
              and external procedures.
</UL>
<P>
A complete program can be self-contained (that is only call internal procedures)
or can make references to other program units (external procedures or
module procedures).
<P>
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 only had one type of procedure which is known in Fortran&nbsp;90 as an 
<EM>external</EM> procedure
(so called because an arbitrary program unit has no knowledge of the
internal structure / argument types or sizes of another procedure).
In F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 
procedures can be compiled separately and then linked with an other
separately compiled F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 
program unit at the time that the object code is generated. This method is very 
flexible
but does not lend itself towards efficient optimisation. There was no
possibility of checking that the type of the corresponding dummy and actual 
arguments match (a fact which was abused
by people who used this shortfall to change the type of an object across 
a procedure boundary)
nor was there any possibility of checking that the size of an array is
the same in the calling and called procedures. Arrays were passed by
relying upon storage and sequence association and their bounds had to
passed as actual arguments. This means that, in a
procedure, an erroneously declared array (too large)
may end up containing meaningless bits of other variables in its last
few locations  or that dummy
arguments following an incorrectly sized array (declared too small in
the procedure) may end up holding rubbish which should have been 
 the last few elements of the array. In short -- all sorts of
mistakes can be made and never get spotted.
<P>
Fortran&nbsp;90 has addressed many of the above mentioned problems so
procedures now look very different.

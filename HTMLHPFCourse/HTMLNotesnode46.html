<P>
  Fortran has some quite strict rules about the order of statements.
 Basically in any program or procedure the following rules must be
used:
<P>
<OL><LI>  The program heading statement must come first, (<TT>PROGRAM</TT>,
      <TT>FUNCTION</TT> or <TT>SUBROUTINE</TT>). A <TT>PROGRAM</TT> statement is optional but
its use is recommended.<LI>  All the specification statements must precede the first executable
     statement. Even though <TT>DATA</TT> statements may be placed with
executable text it is far clearer if they lie in the declaration area.
It is also a good idea to group <TT>FORMAT</TT> statements together for
clarity's sakes.<LI>  The executable statements must follow in the order required by the
     logic of the program.<LI>  The program or procedure must terminate with an <TT>END</TT> statement.
</OL>
<P>
 Within the set of specification statements there is relatively little
ordering required,  however, in general if one entity is used in the
specification of another, it is normally required that it has been 
previously defined.
In other words, named constants (<TT>PARAMETER</TT> s) must be declared before 
they can be used as part of the declaration of other objects.
<P>
The following table  details the prescribed ordering:
<P>
<P> <IMG WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=486 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tabular2546" SRC="HTMLNotesimg8.gif"  > <P>
<P>
Execution of a program begins at the first executable statement of the
<TT>MAIN</TT> <TT>PROGRAM</TT>, when a procedure is called execution begins with
the first executable statement after the invoked entry point. The
non-executable statements are conceptually `executed' (!) simultaneously
on program initiation, in other words they are referenced once and
once only when execution of the main program begins.
<P>
There now follows a explanation of the table, 
<UL><LI> There can be only 1 main <TT>PROGRAM</TT>,<LI> there may be many uniquely named  <TT>FUNCTION</TT> s and <TT>SUBROUTINE</TT> s
program units (procedures).<LI> there may be any number of uniquely named <TT>MODULE</TT> s which are
associated with a program through a <TT>USE</TT> statement. Modules are very
flexible program units and are used to package a number of facilities
(for example, procedures, type definitions, object declarations, or
semantic extensions). Their use is very much encouraged and they replace
a number of unsafe features of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77.<LI> There can be only one <TT>BLOCK</TT> <TT>DATA</TT> subprogram -- these will not
be described as part of this course -- their purpose is to define
global constants or global initialisation and this is best done by a
<TT>MODULE</TT> and <TT>USE</TT> statement.<LI> <TT>USE</TT> statement:
<P>
This attaches a module whose entities become <EM>use-associated</EM> with
the program unit. When a module is used its public contents are accessible as
if they had been declared explicitly in the program unit. Modules may
be pre-compiled (like a library) or may be written by the programmer.
<P>
Any global entities should be placed in  a module and then used whenever
access is required.<LI> The <TT>IMPLICIT</TT> <TT>NONE</TT> statement should be placed after a <TT>USE</TT> statement.
Its use is implored.<LI> <TT>FORMAT</TT> and <TT>ENTRY</TT> statements. Format statements should be grouped
together somewhere in the code. <TT>ENTRY</TT> statements provide a mechanism
to `drop' into a procedure halfway through the executable code. Their
use is outmoded and strongly discouraged due it its dangerous nature.<LI>  <TT>PARAMETER</TT> statement and <TT>IMPLICIT</TT> statement:
<P>
<TT>IMPLICIT</TT> statements should not be used, <TT>IMPLICIT</TT> <TT>NONE</TT> should be
the only form of implicit typing considered. (<TT>IMPLICIT</TT> statements
allow the user to redefine the implication of an object's first letter
in determining what its implicit type will be if it is not declared.
 Cannot have an <TT>IMPLICIT</TT> statement if there is an
<TT>IMPLICIT</TT> <TT>NONE</TT> line.)
<P>
<TT>PARAMETER</TT> statements, it is suggested that the attributed (Fortran&nbsp;90) style of
<TT>PARAMETER</TT> declaration be used.<LI> <TT>DATA</TT> statements should (but do not have to) be placed in the
declaration,  common practice puts them after the declarations and
before the executables.<LI> Interface blocks are generally placed at the head of the declarations
and are grouped together.
<P>
Statement functions are a form of in-line statement definition,
internal procedures should be used instead.<LI> executable statements are things like <TT>DO</TT> statements, <TT>IF</TT> 
constructs
and assignment statements.<LI> <TT>CONTAINS</TT> separates the ``main'' program unit from any
locally visible internal procedures.<LI> the internal procedures follow the same layout as a (normal)
procedure except that they cannot contain a second level of internal
procedure.<LI> the <TT>END</TT> statement is essential to delimit the current program
unit.

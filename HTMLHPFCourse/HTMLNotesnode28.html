In the last ten years Object Oriented Design and Object Oriented
Programming has become increasingly popular; languages such as C++ and
Eiffel have been hailed as the programming languages of the future, but
how does Fortran&nbsp;90 compare?
<P>
Programming paradigms have evolved over the years. With each successive
refinement of programming style have come improvements in readability,
maintainability, reliability, testability, complexity, power, structure
and reusability. The first computer programs were written in assembler
languages and primitive languages such as (the original) Fortran which
possessed only the single statement <TT>IF</TT> and <TT>GOTO</TT> statement to
control the flow of
execution; even procedures had to be simulated using a cunning
combination of <TT>ASSIGN</TT> and <TT>GOTO</TT>. Clearly the
directed graphs of these early programs resembled a bowl of spaghetti
with a vast number of logical paths passing through the code in an
unstructured fashion. Each path of a program represents a unique
combination of predicates which (some argue) must all be tested in order
to gain confidence that the program will function correctly. In
[<A HREF="HTMLNotesnode306.html#Davis">4</A>] Davis presents some estimations of the possible number of
paths through such an unstructured program: a 100 line program can have
up to  <IMG WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=11 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21846" SRC="HTMLNotesimg4.gif"  >  possible paths.
<P>
The next phase of programming style introduced the concept of a
<B>function</B>; code modules could be written and the program
partitioned
into logical (and to some extent) reusable blocks. This had the effect
of reducing the complexity of the program (less paths) and improving the
maintainability, readability and overall structure. A good example of an
advanced functional language is F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77. If the 100 line
program of above could be split into four separate functions then the
number of paths would be reduced to  <IMG WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=11 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21848" SRC="HTMLNotesimg5.gif"  > .
<P>
Functional programming forced the user to adopt better programming
practises, however, there still existed many dimly lit back alleys where
programmers can perform dirty tricks. In F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 one of the <TT>COMMON</TT> block
is one classic example. Due to the absence of high level data structures
(see next paragraph) users were often reluctant to supply seemingly
endless
lists of objects as arguments to functions; it was much easier to hide
things `behind-the-scenes' in a <TT>COMMON</TT> block which allows contiguous
areas of memory to be available to procedures. In F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 it is also  easy
to
inadvertently retype parts of the memory leading to all sort of
problems. For example, the following program was supplied to the
Sun <TT>f77</TT> compiler which generated one warning:
<P>
<PRE>       PROGRAM DUFFER
       DOUBLE PRECISION INIT
       COMMON /GOOF/ INIT, A, B
       CALL WHOOPS()
       PRINT*, &quot;INIT=&quot;, INIT, &quot;A=&quot;, A, &quot;B=&quot;, B
       END
       SUBROUTINE WHOOPS()
       COMMON /GOOF/ INIT, A, B
       INIT = 3
       A = 4
       B = 5
       END</PRE>
<P>
the following output was generated:
<P>
<PRE>    INIT=    6.9006308436664-314A=    5.00000B=  0.</PRE>
<P>
With the introduction of Algol the concept of <B>
structured programming</B> was born; chaotic jumps around the code were
replaced by compact and succinct blocks with a rigidly defined
structure.
Examples of such structures are loops and if blocks. Data was also
allowed
to be structured through the use of pointers and structures. Both these
features allowed for greater modularity, clarity and more compact code.
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 missed the boat with regards to structured data, however, Fortran&nbsp;90 has
corrected this oversight. With this new structure applied, our 100 line
program will now have a maximum of  <IMG WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21850" SRC="HTMLNotesimg6.gif"  >  paths.
<P>
The latest and most fashionable programming paradigm is <B>
object-oriented programming</B>. This style of programming promotes
software
reusability, modularity and precludes certain error conditions by packaging
together type definitions and procedures for the manipulation of objects
of that type. Fortran&nbsp;90 does not have such an extensive range of
object-oriented capabilities as, say, C++ but is comparable to
(original) ADA and provides enough to be of great use to the programmer.

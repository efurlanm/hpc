<P>
By todays standards F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 is outmoded -- many other languages have been
developed which allow
greater expressiveness and ease of programming. The main drawbacks have
been identified as:
<P>
<OL><LI> F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 awkward `punched card' or `fixed form' source format.
<P>
Each line in a F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 program corresponds to
a single punched card with 72 columns meaning that each line can only 
be 72 characters long. This can cause problems and 
in this day and age is totally unnecessary.
<P>
Other restrictions of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77:
<P>
<UL><LI> the first 5 columns are reserved for line numbers;<LI> the 6th column can only be used to indicate a continuation line;<LI> comments can only be initiated by marking the first column with a
special character;<LI> only upper case letters are allowed anywhere in the program;<LI> variable names can only be 6 characters long meaning that mnemonic
and cryptic names must be used all the time -- maintenance unfriendly!<LI> no in-line comments are allowed, comments must be on a line of
their own;
</UL><LI> Lack of inherent parallelism.
<P>
Fortran is supposed to be a performance language -- today High
Performance Computing is implemented on Parallel machines -- F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 has no
in-built
way of expressing parallelism. In the past  calls to specially written
vector subroutines have been used or reliance has been made
on the compiler to vectorise (parallelise)
the sequential (seriel) code. It is much more efficient to give the user control
of parallelism. This has been done, to a certain extent, by the
introduction of parallel `array syntax'.<LI> Lack of dynamic storage.
<P>
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 only allows static storage for example, this means temporary
short-lived arrays cannot be created on-the-fly nor can pointers, which
are
useful for implementing intuitive data structures, be used.
All F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 programs  must declare arrays `big enough' for any future
problem
size which is an awkward and very unattractive restriction absent
in virtually all of the current popular high-level languages.<LI> Lack of numeric portability.
<P>
Problems arise with precision when porting F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 code from one
machine to another. Many F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 systems
implement their own extensions to give greater precision, this means
that the code becomes non-portable. Fortran&nbsp;90 has taken ideas for the various
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 extensions and improved them so that the new language is much more
portable that before.<LI> Lack of user-defined data structures.
<P>
In F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 intuitive (user-defined) data types not available as
they are in ADA, Algol, C, Pascal etc.. Their presence would make
programming more robust and simpler. In F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 there is no way of defining
compound objects.<LI> Lack of explicit recursion.
<P>
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 does not support recursion which is  a very useful and succinct
mathematical technique. In the past this
had to be simulated using a user defined stack and access routines to
manipulate stack entries. Recursion is a fairly simple and a code
efficient concept and was, to all intents and purposes, unavailable.<LI> Relience on unsafe storage and sequence association features.
<P>
In F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77, global data is only accessible via the notoriously
open-to-abuse
<TT>COMMON</TT> block. The rules which applied to <TT>COMMON</TT> blocks are very lax
and the user could inadvertently do quite horrendous things! Fortran&nbsp;90 
presents a new method of obtaining global data.  Another technique which is
equally as open to abuse as <TT>COMMON</TT> blocks is that   a user is allowed to
 alias an array using an <TT>EQUIVALENCE</TT> statement.  A great deal of errors stem
for mistakes in these two areas which are  generally regarded as unsafe,
however, there is no real alternative in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77.
<P>
</OL>

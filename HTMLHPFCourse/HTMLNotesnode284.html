Things to avoid,

</UL>
<P>
One of the hardest tasks of the HPFF was to try to marry F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 
style sequence and storage association  with the HPF concept of
distributed objects. Many of the 
largest and most computationally intensive research programs that 
would benefit the most from conversion to HPF will contain at least 
some sequence or storage association. High Performance Fortran compilers are bound to 
implement Chapter 7 of the HPF Specification; this will be very
important to anybody who wishes to run legacy codes.
<P>
Due to the separate compilation nature of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77, it 
was (and indeed still is) possible to perform many dirty tricks 
with arrays when used as procedure arguments. For example, in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 
programs it was possible, and common, to use assumed-size arrays to
change the shape of an array across a procedure boundary:
<P>
<PRE>       PROGRAM MAIN
       REAL A(10,10)
        ...
       CALL SUBBO(A)

       SUBROUTINE SUBBO(X)
       REAL X(*)
        ...</PRE>
<P>
As a F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 compiler cannot not necessarily see <TT>SUBBO</TT> when compiling
<TT>
MAIN</TT>, it had to rely on the fact that the whole of the actual argument
<TT>
A</TT> is stored as a contiguous block in memory. The assumption that
memory is linear is of course
not the case for a distributed object on a distributed memory
machine. Given that Fortran program units can be separately
compiled, it can be seen that supporting legacy F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 codes could prove
to be
a taxing problem.
<P>
There are other problems too, especially in the
area of storage association, <TT>EQUIVALENCE</TT> and <TT>COMMON</TT> blocks.
<TT>EQUIVALENCE</TT> can be used to change the type and variable name 
that a particular area of
memory is referred through;  <TT>COMMON</TT> blocks provide a mechanism
to access global data. A <TT>COMMON</TT> block reserves a contiguous area of
memory which is accessed through the specified names. Each
instance of a common block can be different which means that the
partitioning of the memory specified by the block can vary from routine
to routine.  For example, the following <TT>COMMON</TT> block could appear in
different procedures in a <EM>separately compiled</EM> Fortran
program:
<P>
<PRE>       COMMON /BLEURGH/ X(10,10),Y(2,22),I(100)
        ...
       COMMON /BLEURGH/ Z(12,12),J(10,10)
        ...
       COMMON /BLEURGH/ I(44),J(100),X(2,50)</PRE>
<P>
If any of the arrays in the <TT>COMMON</TT> blocks are to  be distributed
then a HPF compiler will have a problem! It is highly likely that,
without prior warning, the arrays from these <TT>COMMON</TT> blocks would
be distributed using the default mapping<A NAME="tex2html74" HREF="HTMLNotesfootnode.html#17885"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="localIcons/foot_motif.gif" width="15" height="20"></A>.
This mapping is typically <TT>*</TT> (replication) or <TT>BLOCK</TT> 
distribution.
<P>
The HPFF have defined some additions to Fortran&nbsp;90 to try to lever
sequence and storage association back into the arena.
It is
possible to categorise two distinct situations, one where objects
used in sequence and storage associations can be used as
distributed objects and the second where they cannot. In general,
if a <TT>COMMON</TT> block is used in the same way on every occurrence
then it is possible to distribute its elements. (After the
abovementioned
<TT>COMMON</TT> block problem was recognised it was considered good
programming style to place each <TT>COMMON</TT> block in an <TT>INCLUDE</TT> file and
to
attach this file whenever access to the <TT>COMMON</TT> block was desired.  
This would ensure that every use was forced to be the same.)
<P>
There is a
<TT>SEQUENCE</TT> directive which can be applied either in general or 
to a named entity (variable name or <TT>COMMON</TT> block). This will mean 
that the named entities are stored sequentially 
and it will also allow <TT>COMMON</TT> 
blocks such as <TT>BLEURGH</TT> to be used safely in HPF programs.
The <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> directive must be applied to every instance of <TT>
BLEURGH</TT>.
<P>
<PRE>!HPF$ SEQUENCE :: /BLEURGH/</PRE>
<P>
The HPFF have introduced the concept of covers and aggregates.
In Fortran it is possible to use a <TT>COMMON</TT> or <TT>EQUIVALENCE</TT> statement
to
string together groups of variables by overlapping storage, a 
very simple example would be:
<P>
<PRE>     REAL A(2), B(2), C(2)
     EQUIVALENCE (A(2),B(1))
     EQUIVALENCE (B(2),C(1))</PRE>
<P>
here <TT>A</TT> and <TT>C</TT> are linked by <TT>B</TT> so
 must follow each other in memory. This
group of overlapping variables is called an <EM>aggregate variable
group</EM>. We can define a <EM>cover</EM> for this group in a further
<TT>EQUIVALENCE</TT> statement:
<P>
<PRE>     REAL COVER(4)
     EQUIVALENCE(COVER(1),A(1))</PRE>
<P>
The aggregate variable group are part of a single storage sequence
(aliased as <TT>COVER</TT>) of size 4. Neither <TT>A, B</TT> or <TT>C</TT>
can be mapped but  <TT>COVER</TT>, as long as it is one dimensional, can
be.
<P>
Some variables are automatically sequential (ie they implicitly have 
the <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> attribute). A variable is sequential if it is an
assumed size array, if it appears in a sequential common block, is
a member of an aggregate variable group, if
it is a derived type with the <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> attribute or is given the
HPF <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> attribute. A sequential variable can be storage or
sequence associated ; nonsequential variables cannot.
<P>
A sequential variable cannot be mapped unless it is a scalar or a
rank one array that is an aggregate cover. This means that an
assumed sized array cannot be distributed as it can never be an 
aggregate cover.
<P>
Recent developments at the HPFF have indicated that due to the
complexity and non-usefulness of the mapping of sequential
variables, it looks likely that the next version of HPF, HPF2, will not
allow such
mappings. It will be defined as a language extension!

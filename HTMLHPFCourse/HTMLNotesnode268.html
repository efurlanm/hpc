<P>
Consider the following example,
<P>
<PRE>  INTERFACE
   EXTRINSIC(F77_LOCAL) &amp;
    SUBROUTINE Calc_u_like(My_P_No,Siz,Tot_Proc,a,b,c)
    INTEGER, DIMENSION(:), INTENT(IN)  :: B, C
    INTEGER, DIMENSION(:), INTENT(OUT) :: A
    INTEGER, DIMENSION(:), INTENT(IN)  :: My_P_No
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN)                :: Siz, Tot_Proc
    !HPF$ PROCESSORS, &amp;
    !HPF$  DIMENSION(NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS()) :: P
    !HPF$ DISTRIBUTE (BLOCK) ONTO P          :: A, B, C
    !HPF$ DISTRIBUTE (BLOCK) ONTO P          :: My_P_No
   END SUBROUTINE output ! EXTRINSIC(F77_LOCAL)
  END INTERFACE</PRE>
<P>
The reason
for all the arguments is that when control is inside this procedure, the
processor has no idea that it is inside an extrinsic procedure that was
called from an HPF program. The processor must therefore be given all
the information it needs in order to calculate how big the dummy array
arguments are. (F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 is different from Fortran&nbsp;90. The mechanism for passing
arrays into procedures is much more primitive, the sizes of each
dimension except the last must be supplied in the declaration of the
dummy argument. The last dimension may be left as a <TT>*</TT>; if the actual
extent of this dimension is required then it must be passed as an
argument.)
<P>
It can be seen that, even though the extrinsic is written in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77, (the
precursor to Fortran&nbsp;90,) the interface is expressed in terms of HPF. As usual,
the <TT>INTENT</TT> should be specified to aid the compiler in optimisation.
<P>
The mapping information is <EM>very</EM> very important as when control
passes to the extrinsic, the compiler must make sure that the mapping
specified in the interface is really the way that things are.
If there were no mapping directives specified in the
interface, the compiler will have to ensure that all the dummy
arguments possess the default mapping which is usually replication.
If this was the case, every time the extrinsic subroutine 
<TT>Calc_u_like</TT> is called, the
array actual arguments would have to be remapped so that they were
replicated on every processor in the grid.
<P>
The keyword <TT>F77_LOCAL</TT> is supported by the Portland Compiler, it
allows extrinsics to be written in the F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 language. (The Portland
Compiler also defines a set of message passing routines which allow
different instances of the <TT>F77_LOCAL</TT> extrinsic to communicate
with each other. Explanation of this style of programming is outside the
scope of this course.)
<P>
<A NAME="ExtrinsicExample2">&#160;</A>
In general, every <TT>EXTRINSIC</TT> must:
<P>
<UL><LI> have an explicit <TT>INTERFACE</TT> <EM>including</EM> mapping information,<LI> work out which, if any, array elements are local
</UL>
<P>
The <TT>INTERFACE</TT> is expressed using HPF concepts of <TT>INTENT</TT>, distribution
and
assumed-shape arrays; the <TT>EXTRINSIC</TT> is not.
<P>
These sorts of extrinsic functions are often called <EM>local routines</EM>
because they only have a local picture of the machine that they are
executing on. Such routines only operate on local data and may have no
concept that they are part of a network of processors.
<P>
<A NAME="ExtrinsicExample3">&#160;</A>
Once inside the extrinsic, the first task is to 
calculate the portions of <TT>A, B</TT> and <TT>C</TT> that are local. This
can
be worked out from the original size of the matrices, the number of
processors in each dimension of the HPF processor arrangement and the
distribution method. For example,
<P>
<PRE> SUBROUTINE Calc_u_like(My_P_No,Siz,Tot_Proc,a,b,c)
  INTEGER A(*), B(*), C(*), My_P_No(1), Siz, Tot_Proc
C Find blocksize
  Blk_Siz    = NINT((DBLE(Siz)/DBLE(Tot_Proc))+0.5D0)
C How many elements have I got
  My_Blk_Siz = MIN(Blk_Siz,Siz-(My_P_No(1)-1)*Blk_Siz)
  My_Blk_Siz = MAX(My_Blk_Siz,0)
C Do the Calculation
  DO 100 i = 1,My_Blk_Siz
   a(i) = b(i) + c(i)
  END DO
 END</PRE>
<P>
In the calling program, <TT>P_Nos</TT> has same number of elements as
there are processors and is distributed blockwise so that  each
processor
gets a single element of this array. It has been arranged that this
element contains the number of the processor; the first processor in the
chain is number 1, the second is number 2 and so on. Since the size
of <TT>A</TT> and the total number of processors are given, each extrinsic
can work out the number of array elements that it owns. The calculation
of <TT>Blk_Siz</TT> works out the maximum number of elements that any
processor may have; the calculation of <TT>My_Blk_Siz</TT> works out the
size of the local set. (Recall that in some situations, the last
processors in a chain may have less elements than the first processors
on a chain.) Once the local set has been established, calculations may
proceed as normal (using F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>&nbsp;77 syntax).
<P>
<PRE>  REAL, DIMENSION(Siz) :: A, B = 0, C = 0
  INTEGER, DIMENSION(NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS()) :: P_Nos
  !HPF$ PROCESSORS, &amp;
  !HPF$  DIMENSION(NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS()) :: P
  !HPF$ DISTRIBUTE (BLOCK) ONTO P :: A, B, C, P_Nos
    ... Interface from before goes here
  NOP   = NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS()
  P_Nos = (/ (i, i=1,NOP) /)
  CALL Calc_u_like(P_Nos,SIZE(A),NOP,A,B,C)
 END</PRE>
<P>
<EM>Now try this question <A HREF="HTMLQuestionsnode130.html#QF77LocalExtrinsics"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="localIcons/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"></A></EM>
<P>
C routines will have to follow a similar method in order to
establish their local sets.
<P>
<A NAME="ExtrinsicExample4">&#160;</A>
<P>
Some compilers, (but not Portland,) may support <TT>F90_LOCAL</TT>
routines. If this is the case, then matters can be much simplified by
using assumed-shape arrays. In this example, there is no need to
calculate the local set; the Fortran&nbsp;90 <TT>SIZE</TT> intrinsic could be used if this
needs to be established.
<P>
<PRE> SUBROUTINE Calc_u_like(A,B,C)
  INTEGER, DIMENSION(:), INTENT(IN)  :: B, C
  INTEGER, DIMENSION(:), INTENT(OUT) :: A
   A = B+C
 END</PRE>
<P>
Note how the extrinsic is relying on the sensible way in
which Fortran&nbsp;90 treats zero-sized arrays to remove the need for block-size
calculations.
